    <p>Robbing from the rich has never been so fun! A greedy prince has taken control of England, and it is up to Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men—and women!—to fight for justice and champion for the underdog. From comic mastermind Ken Ludwig (Lend Me a Tenor, Crazy for You) comes this rollicking and inventive play, packed with delightful thrills, amorous exploits, contagious laughs, and great beloved heroes like Little John, Friar Tuck, and Maid Marian. So get ready to dodge an arrow or two—you won’t want to miss a moment of this swashbuckling adventure!</p>
