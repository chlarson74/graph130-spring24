                    <h3>What is Growth Mindset?</h3>
                    <p>A growth mindset is a transformative approach to learning and development that empowers individuals to embrace challenges, persist through setbacks, and ultimately achieve higher levels of success. Rooted in the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work, it contrasts with a fixed mindset, which assumes that abilities are innate and unchangeable.</p>

                <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                    <h3>Failure Stimulate Growth</h3>
                    <p>Central to the growth mindset is the idea that failures and difficulties are not indicators of a person's limitations, but rather opportunities for learning and improvement. Instead of viewing setbacks as discouraging roadblocks, individuals with a growth mindset see them as stepping stones on the path to mastery. This outlook fosters resilience and tenacity, enabling individuals to persevere in the face of obstacles.</p>

                    <h3>Embrace Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Embracing challenges is a cornerstone of the growth mindset. Rather than shying away from difficult tasks, individuals actively seek them out, recognizing that they provide the greatest potential for growth. They approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to stretch their abilities, knowing that even if they don't immediately succeed, they are still expanding their skills and knowledge.</p>

                <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                    <h3>Give your best effort</h3>
                    <p>Effort is highly valued in a growth mindset. It's understood that hard work, dedication, and deliberate practice are the keys to improvement. This mindset rejects the notion of innate talent as the primary determinant of success, instead attributing achievement to a combination of effort and strategy. This perspective empowers individuals to take ownership of their progress and strive for excellence.</p>

                    <h3>Embrace Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Feedback is welcomed and appreciated in a growth mindset. Constructive criticism is seen as an invaluable source of information for refining skills and knowledge. It's not taken personally, but rather as a means to accelerate growth and development</p>

                    <h3>Dedication and Hard Work Payoff</h3>
                    <p>Furthermore, individuals with a growth mindset are inspired by the success of others. They see others' achievements not as threats, but as evidence of what is possible with dedication and hard work. They are eager to learn from and collaborate with those who have excelled in their field.</p>
