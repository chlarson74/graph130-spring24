<p>“The Internet as we know it really got started in the early 1960s. That was when J.C.R. Licklider — a computer scientist with technology company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) — formulated a few unique ideas about global networking in a series of memos, describing an <b>"Intergalactic Computer Network."</b><br>
    His idea: link computers together across the globe; and anybody near a computer could share information. As it turns out, Licklider had the right idea at the right time. The Cold War had the United States searching for a communication network that could survive a nuclear attack.”<br>

    <p>(Published text has always been marked up so that the author and publisher would be able to synchronize and layout a 
    publication the way it has been envisioned. TBL created a markup language that tells a web browser how to visually display a page the way the “author” envisioned it.)</p>

<p>During the 90’s there were browser wars and HTML was becoming fragmented. TBL created <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">The World Wide Web Consortium</a> to maintain HTML standards.</p>
